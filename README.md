LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is a simple Library Management System built using C#. It demonstrates the use of LINQ to join data from two related tables: Authors and Books. The system showcases basic data manipulation and retrieval operations.

--Project Overview--

The system consists of two classes that represent the structure of a basic library:
-Authors Table: Contains information about authors, including a unique Author ID and the author's name.

-Books Table: Contains details about books, including a unique Book ID, book title, and the associated Author ID, linking it to the corresponding author.

A LINQ query is used to join these tables, providing a combined view of books and their respective authors.

--Features--

Join operation between two related tables using LINQ.
Sample data creation for authors and books.
Display of each book title alongside its corresponding author.

--Technologies Used--

C#: Core programming language used to develop the system.
.NET Core: Provides the runtime environment for C# applications.
LINQ (Language Integrated Query): Used for querying and joining data from collections.
Visual Studio: IDE used for coding and debugging the project.
